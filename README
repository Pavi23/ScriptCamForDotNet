ScriptCam is a popular JQuery plugin to manipulate webcams.
It works a flash component to access your web camera.
Here's the plugin website: http://www.scriptcam.com/

I wanted to integrate it to an Asp.Net page for only capturing images.
It all works with javascript, then when you're done, it stores the data in a Session variable.

That way you can take the capture on client and store the data in server.

I've shared the URL in my personal page also,
I'll be glad to hear if you have something to say.
