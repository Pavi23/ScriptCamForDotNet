ScriptCam is a popular JQuery plugin to manipulate webcams.
It works a flash component to access your web camera.
Here's the plugin website: http://www.scriptcam.com/

I wanted to integrate it to an Asp.Net page for only capturing images.
It all works with javascript, then when you're done, it stores the data in a Session variable.

That way you can take the capture on client and store the data in server.
